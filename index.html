<h2> School Life </h2> 	
<p>
 My school life is very funny and happy and emotional and lots of memories mixed.<i> First My family lived in chenni<b> Poovirunthamalli </b>.</i>. We came THhirunelveli when I was four. 
 I thought my 1 to 8th school is my house to 2 street dsistence.This school name is thirugnayana sambanthar middle school. Just a very beautiful and my life full filed school. 
 I will never forget that school. Because It was in that school that I got everything.I will never forget Sankar sir , my sixth to eighth grade teacher.
<marn> <ins> Now he is the reason I joined this freshworks </mark> </ins>. I came here following the way he showed me.He has always been a mentor to me and my sister and still is.
So whenever I mention that school, my teacher's memories come to me.I don't like English.There is only one reason why I like English because of my sir
</p>

<p>
 I studyed in 9th to 12th in my village  Bharathiyar Government Hr Sec school.I got some really nice and loving friends in that school.I will never forget those friends.
They were not only my friends but also my brothers and sisters bonding .We all play pranks together and play with water.We got stuck with the headmaster on the last day of school.
Then my friends were laughing and I was also laughing We had no fear We were always a beautiful loving friends.That school gave me a completeness because I had beautiful friends and good teachers.
My teachers gave me and my school friends a lot of advice when I was finishing school.So that moment turned out to be a beautiful moment for us.

<h2> My Turning point </h2>

 The only confusion I had was when I finished 12th and returned home.Next I was worried about what I was going to do, what I was going to study, what work I was going to do.
My mother and father advised me and others my own friends all advised me to read this and read that and don't read that.I finally decided to go to college.
I like Chemistry very much so I decided to join Chemistry course as well.Then one night I got a call.My eighth grade teacher called me.I picked up the phone and my sir talked to me about this issue.
He share me the link.That link  brought me here.My parents were very supportive.All thanks to my parents and my teacher i submit. <mark> <ins> Freshworks</mark></ins> was a turning point for me, I believe
